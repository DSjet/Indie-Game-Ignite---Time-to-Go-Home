    - It is expected.
    - However...
    - I am afraid that I may not be able to make everything sensible in the time
      being.
    - So for now, I will just say that you are my chosen one.
    - I have granted you a fragment of my power

    - It is in my best interest to not answer that question now.
    - What I can say however, is that I will grant you more of my power.
    - But it is implored for you to use it wisely.
    - "Your time is ticking and you don\u2019t want it to lose even faster, right?"
    - It is best for you to keep heading toward your initial destination for now.
    - Answers to all of your questions might just be revealed to you on your journey.
    - ' Have a safe trip Little One, I will always be by your side.'
